## The Problem

### Schools Are Drowning in Administrative Chaos

Every day, school administrators juggle:
- Paper-based student records scattered across filing cabinets
- Excel spreadsheets that break when someone accidentally deletes a row
- Payment tracking in notebooks that get lost between semesters
- Report cards that take weeks to compile by hand
- Communication gaps between teachers, parents, and administration

**The result?** Hours wasted on manual processes. Frustrated staff. Confused parents. And students who fall through the cracks.
